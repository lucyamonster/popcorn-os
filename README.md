# Hi and welcome to the tasty? crazy of popcorn OS
Popcorn is a small operating system built on the idea of a kernel interpreted language named caramel.
This is a hobby project and nothing serious so don't expect it to ever do much. If you have a question open an issue ig.

## status
### Currently only a rough structure exist:
- #### popcorn honey
    The kernel that is doomed from the start
- #### popcorn caramel
    The language that salted can run and will be used for all userspace apps.
- #### popcorn salted
    The language interpreter that runs caramel and is built into the honey kernel.
- #### popcorn cinnamon
    The language interpreter for caramel that can be run on another os to develop and test caramel code.

### There are currently two projects:
- Get the honey kernel basics done
- Define the basics for caramel and write a first version of cinnamon for it.
