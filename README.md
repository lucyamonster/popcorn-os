# Hi and welcome to the tasty? crazy of popcorn OS
Popcorn is a small operating system built on the idea of a kernel interpreted language named cherry.
This is a hobby project and nothing serious so don't expect it to ever do much. If you have a question open an issue ig.

## status
### Currently only a rough structure exist:
- #### honey popcorn
    The kernel that is doomed from the start
- #### cherry popcorn
    The language that caramel can run and will be used for all userspace apps.
- #### straberry and blueberry caramel popcorn
    Scanner and intermediate parts of caramel. These are designed to be the same for raspberry and blackberry.
- #### raspberry caramel popcorn
    The language interpreter that runs cherry and is built into the honey kernel.
- #### blackberry caramel popcorn
    The language interpreter for cherry that can be run on another os to develop and test cherry code.

### There are currently two projects:
- Define the basics for cherry and write a first version of caramel (excluding the raspberry back end) for it.
- Get the honey kernel basics done

### Full to-do:
- [ ] Setup honey basics
- [ ] Setup the frontend parts of caramel and spec out cherry
- [ ] Get the blackberry caramel backend setup
- [ ] Write a testing/evaluation script in cherry to test if the caramel stacks work
- [ ] Write raspberry caramel
- [ ] add the remaining features needed for a basic os to cherry and the carmal stack ( Input, file support, etc)
- [ ] Write a shell in cherry.
- [ ] Write all the core utils that are deesired in cherry (ls, cat, rm, etc)
- [ ] Enjoy and have fun!
